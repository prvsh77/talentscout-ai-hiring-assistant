File 2: app.py
Copy the ENTIRE code from my first artifact titled "app.py - Main Hiring Assistant"

# (or wherever you created the folder)
Run setup:

This will:

Create virtual environment
Install all dependencies
Set up everything automatically
🔑 STEP 4: Get API Key (5 minutes)

Sign up (free account)
Use your email
Verify email
They give you FREE credits to start!
Get API Key:
Click "API Keys" in sidebar
Click "Create Key"
COPY the key (you'll need it soon)
🎯 STEP 5: Test It! (5 minutes)
In your terminal, run:

bash
streamlit run app.py
It will automatically open in your browser at http://localhost:8501

What you'll see:

Beautiful purple/blue interface
Sidebar on left with "Configuration"
"Enter API Key" field
Paste your API key in the sidebar → Press Enter

Now test the chatbot:

Type "yes" to start

Answer the technical questions
See the completion screen!
🎨 STEP 6: Test Enhanced Version (5 minutes)

This version has:

✨ Sentiment analysis (emojis appear next to your messages!)

Test it again with a different tech stack!

✅ CHECKLIST - What You Should Have Now:

 Both versions run without errors
🚨 IF YOU GET ERRORS:
Error: "Command not found: streamlit"
bash
# Make sure you're in the virtual environment
# Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# Then try again:
streamlit run app.py
Error: "API key invalid"
Double-check you copied the entire key
Make sure there are no extra spaces
Try creating a new key
Error: "Module not found"
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
📸 STEP 7: Take Screenshots (10 minutes)
While the app is running, take screenshots of:

The landing page
A conversation in progress
